"""Write-side guard that refuses to pin a self-inconsistent catalog snapshot.

Root-cause prevention for the persistent-hydration incident: an alias revision
must never pin a normalized snapshot whose stored content does not hash to its
pinned digest, because a same-version mismatch is unservable and 503s every
alias on it. This verifies content against digest at the activation seam.

    """Refuse to pin a snapshot whose stored content does not match its digest.

    When the ``<sha>.json`` file is present under ``state_dir``, its bytes must
    parse and hash to ``catalog_sha256`` (a cross-version snapshot is tolerated
    exactly as the serving reader tolerates it); a same-version mismatch, a
    malformed file, or a present-but-unreadable file fails the activation loudly
    so a self-inconsistent (or unverifiable) snapshot never becomes an alias
    authority. Only a genuinely ABSENT file (a pin whose content lives on another
    node) cannot be verified here, so that case flags and proceeds rather than
    blocking a legitimate cross-node activation.
